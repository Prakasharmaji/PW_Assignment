    "Que1. who developed python programming language?\n",
    "Ans. Guido van Rossum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Que2. Which type of Programming does Python support?\n",
    "Ans. Python is an interpreted programming language, which supports object-oriented, structured, and functional programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Que3. Is Python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers?\n",
    "Ans. Yes, Case is always significant while dealing with identifiers in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Que4. What is the correct extension of the Python file?\n",
    "Ans. ‘.py’ is the correct extension of the Python file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Que5. Is Python code compiled or interpreted?\n",
    "Ans. Python code is both compiled and interpreted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Que6. Nmae a few blocks of code used to in Python language?\n",
    "Ans. In Python, to define a block of code we use indentation. Indentation refers to whitespaces at the beginning of the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Que7. State a character used to give single-line comments in Python?\n",
    "Ans. To write single-line comments in Python use the Hash character (#) at the beginning of the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Que8. Mention functions which can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on?\n",
    "Ans. The function sys.version can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Que9. Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime, using a construct called __________\n",
    "Ans. lambda.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Que10. What does pip stand for python?\n",
    "Ans. Preferred Installer Program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Que11. Mention a few biuld-in-functions in python?\n",
    "Ans. The built-in functions are part of the Python language. Examples are: dir(), len() or abs().\n",
    "\n",
    "Que12. What is the maximum possible length of an identifier in Python?\n",
    "Ans. Identifiers can be of any length.\n",
    "\n",
    "Que13. What are the Benefits of Using Python?\n",
    "More than being an exceptional programming language, it is the combination of features that makes Python widely adopted for diverse applications development.\n",
    "•\tThird-Party Modules\n",
    "Python Package Index (PyPI) comprises a multitude of third-party modules which makes Python integrate with other languages and platforms easily.\n",
    "•\tPresence of Libraries\n",
    "Python is fraught with numerous standard libraries that include string operations, internet protocols, web service tools, Machine Learning libraries, and operating System Interfaces. The presence of these libraries essentially helps in reducing the code to be written by the programmer.\n",
    "•\tOpen Source and free\n",
    "Python is free for use even for commercial purposes. Moreover, active developers can contribute by developing modules and appending them to the existing library.\n",
    "•\tHuge Support Community\n",
    "Due to lack of official technical support for Python is open-sourced has prompted the development of communities that enrich the resource bank for continued development and adoption of the language.\n",
    "•\tEasy to learn\n",
    "Python is popular for its excellent readability. This means, even a non-programmer can read and comprehend the uncluttered syntax. The PEP 8 guidelines provide a set of rules to help in formatting the code.\n",
    "•\tUser-Friendly data structures\n",
    "With its built-in data structures, Python can easily construct run-time data structures including Arrays, Lists, tuples, and Files.  \n",
    "•\tSpeed\n",
    "Being expressive and with object-oriented design, Python contributes to increased speed and productivity even with less amount of coding. Python is considered ideal for developing complex, multi-protocol network applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Que14. How is memory managed in Python?\n",
    "Ans. Memory management in Python involves a private heap containing all Python objects and data structures. The management of this private heap is ensured internally by the Python memory manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "Que15. How to install Python on Windows and set path variable\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Install python from this link https://www.python.org/downloads/\n",
    "After this, install it on your PC. Look for the location where PYTHON has been installed on your PC using tge following command on your command prompt: cmd python.\n",
    "Then go to advanced system settings and add new variable and name it as PYTHON_NAME and paste the copied path.\n",
    "Then look for the path variable, select it's value and select edit\n",
    "Add a semicolon towards the end of the value if it's not present and then type %PYTHON_HOME%\n",
    "\n",
    "Que16. Is indentation required in python?\n",
    "Ans. Yes, Indentation is mandatory in python to define the blocks of statements.\n"
